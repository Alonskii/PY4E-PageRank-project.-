# PY4E-PageRank-project.-
Visualization done with two different websites.. and results all uploaded accordingly. 

The project starts at spider.py, where we retrieve pages from our websites.. Then we proceed to run the sprank script and set the iteration at 100.. 
When that is completed, then we run the spdump script which shows the number of rows completed.. Next, we run the spjson.py file and include how many nodes we want in the 
visualization, then we proceed to open the force.html file to view our visualization and ascertain that we got the expected result..
